/* Cascade:
Specifity means more specific rule always wins (ID > Class > Type > Universal).
The rule with the largest number of selectors always wins if specificity is equal.
Typography-based properties (color, font-size, font-family, etc.) are usually inherited by child
but these are always overwritten by more specific rules.
If there are conflicting rules for the same number of selectors of the same type, rule defined last
(nearest the bottom of the css document) wins.
